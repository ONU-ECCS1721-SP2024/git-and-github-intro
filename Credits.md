# Credits

This repository was originally a fork (copy) of [GitHub Education's open-source GitHub Starter Course](https://github.com/education/github-starter-course). I ([@RyzenFromFire](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire)) have modified it and combined it with some other guides I have written. The result aligns more closely with my GitHub Classroom tutorial and is more instructive, whereas the original was more informative. I also wanted to better emphasize the difference between Git and GitHub, as I feel that's often overlooked when introducing new programmers to this ecosystem.

If you're an instructor who wants to utilize this resource for your own classes, feel free to do so. The original repository was open-source and unlicensed as far as I can tell. Anything here that could be considered my intellectual property is likewise open-source and unlicensed, and I give permission for any educational use. Like the original, this repository is a template that you can directly use as starter code for an assignment in GitHub Classroom. I encourage you to do so.

If you're a student who has been given an assignment based on this repository, thanks for reading this guide. I hope it helps in your programming journey. 

For instructors, students, and any other reader - if you have any feedback or think this guide could be improved, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
